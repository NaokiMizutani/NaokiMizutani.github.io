  <section class="post-content"><p>統計分析結果をブラウザ上にグラフとして表示するためのライブラリの試用</p>

<p>グラフを表示する Javascript ライブラリはいくつもあるようだが、
その中で <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a> というライブラリを試してみた。</p>

<p>サイトのデモを見ながら、組み込みたい機能を決めて、<a href="http://www.highcharts.com/download">ダウンロード</a> したサンプルプログラムを参考に作りたいグラフに近づけていく。</p>

<p>最終的には Javascript を生成する方法を考えなければならないが、
高機能なグラフを比較的簡単に利用できるのはありがたい。</p>
